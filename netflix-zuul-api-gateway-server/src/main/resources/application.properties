# By default, all requests to currency conversion service for example will start with: "/currency-converter/"

# What will be sent to the gallery service is what comes after the path defined,

# So, if request is "/currency-converter/from/USD/to/AUD/quantity/10", currency conversion service will get "/currency-converter/from/USD/to/AUD/quantity/10".

# In case of auth, we need to pass the "/auth/" in the path to auth service. So, set strip-prefix to false
